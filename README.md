## Description

An informational web page for a science museum. Built to inform potential visitors about the museum, it's exhibitions and special events. An attention grabber designed for kids (Find Eve), encourages the user to search through pages to find Eve. Main goal is to have the user browse more pages than planned.

Events are dynamicly displayed. Events older than a week will be hidden, and the rest will be displayed in future and recently past events. There is also a feature to Reserve Seat, which works as intended, but a backend is not implemented so it resets.

- Sorting events
- Date/Time Handling
- Auto-hides past events
- Seat Reservation (no backend though)
- Content from JSON-file

## Contributing

This was made for a school project so I'm not planning for regular maintenance, but rather use it to show some of my work.
